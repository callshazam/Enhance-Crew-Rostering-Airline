# Enhance Airline Crew Rostering 

## Product Overview

This solution focuses on crew rostering problem of airline industry. It provides the work schedule for each crew member considering different aspects like limitation on maximum flying hours, maximum overall hours, number of assigned crew for each flight, and rest period of a crew between two consecutive flights. This solution derives the work schedules of each crew member while reducing load imbalance among the crew members. This reduces the cost of operations, optimizes the crew size required, improves the service levels and airline safety and at the same time ensures crew well-being.

## Product Highlight
* Airline Crew rostering uses heuristic based optimization approach, which is computationally efficient to handle large datasets as compared to the classical optimization based approaches. This solution is tested on a very large publicly available dataset. It outputs the work schedules of each crew member for the given timeperiod based on user input constraint parameters.
* This solution can be used by Airlines to generate the optimal rosters for their crew keeping in view their well-being and at the same time optimizing the costs.
* Mphasis Optimize.AI is an AI-centric process analysis and optimization tool that uses AI/ML techniques to mine the event logs to deliver business insights. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
